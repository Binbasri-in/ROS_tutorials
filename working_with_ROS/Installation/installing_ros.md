## Installing ROS with VsCode and its Terminals

1. Open a terminal in your WSL2 environment using Visual Studio Code (VsCode):
   - If you don't have VsCode installed, download it from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
   - Launch VsCode and search for "Ubuntu" in the search bar. Run the Ubuntu application.
   - In VsCode, open a new terminal by either going to `Terminal -> New Terminal` in the menu or using the shortcut `Ctrl + Shift + `

2. Add the ROS repository to your package sources:
   - Run the following command in the terminal:
     ```shell
     sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
     ```

3. Install `cURL` to download the ROS keys:
   ```shell
   sudo apt install curl
   ```

4. Set up the ROS keys:
   ```shell
   curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.asc | sudo apt-key add -
   ```

5. Update the package lists:
   ```shell
   sudo apt update
   ```

6. Install the ROS base package:
   ```shell
   sudo apt install ros-noetic-desktop-full
   ```
   Note: Replace "noetic" with the appropriate version like "melodic" or "kinetic" if needed.

7. Install ROS Python dependencies:
   ```shell
   sudo apt install python3-rosdep python3-rosinstall python3-rosinstall-generator python3-wstool build-essential
   ```

8. Initialize rosdep, which is used to install ROS dependencies:
   ```shell
   sudo rosdep init
   ```
   ```shell
   rosdep update
   ```

9. Add the ROS environment variables to your shell session:
   ```shell
   echo "source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
   ```
   ```shell
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

10. Install Catkin tools and tutorials for TurtleSim:
    ```shell
    sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-catkin python3-catkin-tools
    ```
    ```shell
    sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-ros-tutorials
    ```

11. Verify the installation by running the following command, which should display the available ROS packages:
    ```shell
    roscore
    ```
    Note: If you encounter an error, try running `rosdep update` again.

12. Check the `Turtlesim` package by running the following commands:
    - In a new terminal, run:
      ```shell
      roscore
      ```
    - In another new terminal, run:
      ```shell
      rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node
      ```
    - In another new terminal, run:
      ```shell
      rosrun turtlesim turtle_teleop_key
      ```
    Now, you can control the turtle using the arrow keys.

13. Create a workspace directory for your ROS workspace:
    ```shell
    mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
    ```
    ```shell
    cd ~/catkin_ws/
    ```
    ```shell
    catkin init
    ```
    ```shell
    catkin build
    ```
    ```shell
    echo "source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
    ```
    You can add the last command to the `~/.bashrc` file to run it automatically when opening a new terminal.

## Possible Errors and Fixes

1. **"No protocol specified" error:** If you

 encounter this error when running a GUI application, make sure Xming is running and the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly. Use the command `export DISPLAY=:0` before running any GUI applications.

2. **Missing dependencies:** If you encounter missing package dependencies during the ROS installation, try running `sudo apt --fix-broken install` to automatically resolve and install the missing packages.

3. **Networking issues:** If you experience networking issues in WSL2, such as being unable to access the internet or connect to other devices on your network, you may need to configure WSL2 networking correctly. Refer to the official Microsoft documentation on WSL networking for troubleshooting steps.

With these steps, you should be able to install ROS using VsCode and its terminals in Windows WSL2. Enjoy using ROS!
